## üåå Introduction

This document presents not just a critique, but an observational **refutation** of the concept of dark matter. Based on data from ESA's Gaia mission, I show that galactic dynamics can be explained without invoking dark halos or invisible mass. Observable kinematic patterns ‚Äî such as increasing dispersion, discrete wave-like stellar shells, and a decoupling of stellar mass from velocity ‚Äî demand we abandon the outdated idea of dark matter.

Additionally, a theoretical argument is presented showing that **neutrons could not have existed in the early universe**, undermining the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis model and reinforcing a stellar origin of all baryonic matter.

## üìä Observational Evidence

### Figure 1: Real Velocity in x, y, z by Galactic Hemisphere

![Figure 1: Asymmetrical velocity North/South](https://estradad.es/teorias/gaia_analisis/plots/velocidad_asimetria_norte_sur.png)

Stellar velocities Vx (green), Vy (blue), and Vz (red) increase in both magnitude and dispersion with distance from the galactic center. A clear **north/south asymmetry** is observed. These kinematics are not easily reconciled with the presence of a uniform dark matter halo.

### Figure 2: Stellar Structure in Radial Waves

Graph-based analysis shows stars distributed in concentric wavefronts or shells radiating from the galactic core. This strongly supports a dynamic model where stars are periodically **ejected from supermassive black holes**, not statically orbiting an invisible mass.

### Figure 3: Tangential Velocity vs. Stellar Mass

![Figure 3: Mass vs. velocity](https://estradad.es/teorias/gaia_analisis/plots/influecia%20masa%20velocidad.png)

Beyond a certain threshold, tangential velocity **stabilizes regardless of stellar mass**. This breaks with gravitational expectations: more mass should mean more influence, yet the velocity dispersion continues growing ‚Äî while mass ceases to correlate. Gravity alone cannot explain this.

## üß† Theoretical Argument: Neutrons Could Not Exist in the Early Universe

- Free neutron half-life: ~880 seconds (‚àº14.7 minutes)  
- Maximum causal propagation radius: ~15 light-minutes  
- In a homogeneous early universe without stellar nuclei, **no neutron could remain stable**.

**Conclusion:** All neutrons in existence must have originated inside stars. This **invalidates Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions** and demands a revised understanding of baryonic matter production.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Scientific Declaration

This work is not speculative theory. It is an **observational assault on the dark matter hypothesis**, using real Gaia data to expose the cracks in the dominant gravitational paradigm. The radial, wave-based, and mass-independent patterns observed should force astrophysics to reconsider its core assumptions.

I invite the scientific community ‚Äî especially those working with Gaia, ESAC, and gravitational dynamics ‚Äî to scrutinize, replicate, and debate this model in the open.
